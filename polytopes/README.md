This folder contain the directories with the facets and vertices of the polytopes for the extended Bell scenarios considered during this master's project.

Description of the scenarios:

- *2-pentagon*: Alice and Bob have measurements $\mathcal{M}_A = \\{ A_0, A_1 \\}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{B} = \\{ B_0, B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4 \\}$, respectively. Alice's measurements are incompatible, while Bob's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations of a 5-cycle $\mathcal{C}_{B} = \\{ \\{ B_0, B_1 \\}, \\{ B_1, B_2 \\}, \\{ B_2, B_3 \\}, \\{ B_3, B_4 \\}, \\{ B_4, B_0 \\} \\}$. Each measurement has two possible results.

- *2-square*: Alice and Bob have measurements $\mathcal{M}_{A} = \\{ A_0, A_1 \\}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{B} = \\{ B_0, B_1, B_2, B_3\\}$, respectively. Alice's measurements are incompatible, while Bob's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations of a 4-cycle $\mathcal{C}_{B} = \\{ \\{ B_0, B_1 \\}, \\{ B_1, B_2 \\}, \\{ B_2, B_3 \\}, \\{ B_3, B_0 \\} \\}$. Each measurement has two possible results.

- *2-triangle*: Alice and Bob have measurements $\mathcal{M}_{A} = \\{ A_0, A_1 \\}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{B} = \\{ B_0, B_1, B_2 \\}$, respectively. Alice's measurements are incompatible, while Bob's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations 3-cycle $\mathcal{C}_{B} = \\{ \\{ B_0, B_1 \\}, \\{ B_1, B_2 \\}, \\{ B_2, B_0 \\}\\}$. Each measurement has two possible results.

- *2-V*: Alice and Bob have measurements $\mathcal{M}_{A} = \\{ A_0, A_1 \\}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{B} = \\{ B_0, B_1, B_2\\}$, respectively. Alice's measurements are incompatible, while Bob's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations $\mathcal{C}_{B} = \\{ \\{ B_0, B_1 \\}, \\{ B_1, B_2 \\} \\}$. Each measurement has two possible results.

- *V-V-222-222*: Alice and Bob have measurements $\mathcal{M}_{A} = \\{ A_0, A_1, A_2 \\}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{B} = \\{ B_0, B_1, B_2\\}$, respectively. Alice's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations $\mathcal{C}_{A} = \\{ \\{ A_0, A_1 \\}, \\{ A_1, A_2 \\} \\}$, while Bob's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations $\mathcal{C}_{B} = \\{ \\{ B_0, B_1 \\}, \\{ B_1, B_2 \\} \\}$. Each measurement has two possible results.

- *V-V-233-233*: Alice and Bob have measurements $\mathcal{M}_{A} = \\{ A_0, A_1, A_2 \\}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{B} = \\{ B_0, B_1, B_2\\}$, respectively. Alice's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations $\mathcal{C}_{A} = \\{ \\{ A_0, A_1 \\}, \\{ A_1, A_2 \\} \\}$, while Bob's measurements satisfy the compatibility relations $\mathcal{C}_{B} = \\{ \\{ B_0, B_1 \\}, \\{ B_1, B_2 \\} \\}$. The measurements $\\{ A_0, B_0 \\}$ have two possible results, while the measurements $\\{ A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2 \\}$ have three possible results.
