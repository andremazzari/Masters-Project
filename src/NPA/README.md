This folder contains files implementing the NPA hierarchy. This consists of a sequence o **Semi-Definite Programs** used to verify if the probabilities obtained in a Bell experiment can be described by quantum theory.

The library **PICOS** for Python was used for **Semi-Definite Programming**. I also made use of **Object-Oriented Programming** to create a class for the elements of the NPA hierarchy.
